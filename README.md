# influence-maximization-problem
The influence maximization problem (IMP) aims to determine the most influential individuals within a social network under interest. In fact, the problem consist of finding a small subset of nodes (seed nodes) in a graph that could maximize the spread of influence.

In this study, the independent cascade (IC) diffusion model is considered. Regardless of the diffusion model, a node *i* is called active or influenced if it performs the action of interest or accepts the shared idea. Whenever a node becomes active, it cannot deactivate and remains an active node during the entire broadcast process.
